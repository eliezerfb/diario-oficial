Since Di√°rio Oficial seeks to become a trustful source of official governmental announcements, every data source must also be trustful. A private company publishing government gazettes without official permission, for instance, is not a trustful source.

At this moment, the project aims for the 100 top Brazilian municipalities by population, collecting all the gazettes since 2015. If you want to help us reach this goal, [an ordered list can be found on Wikipedia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_de_munic%C3%ADpios_do_Brasil_por_popula%C3%A7%C3%A3o).

## Automated Testing

The project is backed by a test suite, which can be run with a single command.

```console
$ make test
```
